		<meta name="description" content="(RADIO STATIC) This is Agent Leland Turbo. I have a flash transmission for Agent Finn McMissile. Finn, my cover's been compromised. Everything's gone pear-shaped. You won't believe what I found out here. This is bigger than anything we've ever seen, and no one even knows it exists. Finn, I need backup, but don't call the cavalry, it could blow the operation. And be careful. It's not safe out here. CAR: Let's go. Transmitting my grids now. Good luck. (BEEPING) All right, buddy, we're here. Right where you paid me to bring you. Question is, why? I'm looking for a car. A car? Ha! Hey, pal, you can't get any further away from land than out here. Exactly where I want to be. I got news for you, buddy. There's nobody out here but us. (SHIP'S HORN) SHIP: What are you doing out here? What does it look like, genius? I'm crabbing. ">
