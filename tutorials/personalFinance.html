                                    <h1>A Personal Finance Guide for the Modern Person</h1><address>By Joe Sedutto, September 2018<br><br></address>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                                            Personal finance, a lot of people know right off what personal finance
                                            is, it's your personal, finances, your money, and more importantly, how
                                            you manage your own money. If you search "Personal Finance" into
                                            google, you get, thousands, millions, almost a billion results and
                                            counting articles and blogs and studies all with an underlying piece
                                            of advice "Save more than you Spend" well, there you go, personal
                                            finance seems easy, with such simple advice at our fingertips, it makes
                                            me wonder why in this year, the average person spends 133% of their
                                            income.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 133% that's an extra 1/3d dollar spend
                                                    for each dollar they earn, people overspend, people go into debt,
                                                    why?&nbsp;In a study 2017, with research from a year or so earlier,
                                                    CNBC reported that;<br><table style="width: 556px; height: 80px; text-align: left; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr><td align="center">"Only
8 percent of [people polled] had a high level of knowledge [of personal
finance], while about a quarter, or 24 percent, demonstrated just a
basic understanding of how to manage their money. Yet 69 percent gave
themselves high marks for financial know-how."<br><address>-Jessica Dickler, "Millennials aren't as smart about money as they think"&nbsp;&nbsp; </address></td></tr></tbody></table>if
personal finance is so easy how can you have millions of Americans
going into debt like this. Obviously, we can figure this out, its clear
this wisdom is old, unrefuted, and, by the 133% fact, the advice is
ignored, so what can you do?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
People need another kind of article, a guide that does not just tell
you what to do to not overspend, a guide that tells you why you are
overspending, because its clear that using conventional wisdom is not
working, just like telling a smoker that smoking is bad, telling a
person that debt is bad won't make them stop.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Social Pressure. Social pressure is just what it sounds like, society
putting pressure on you, you experience social pressure when you're
waiting in line for coffee, you don't cut in front because society
tells you it's bad, you wear clothes when you're in town because
society has pressured you to do that, and that's ok, social pressure is
a double edged sword, able to keep a community together, but also able
to make a community do something, for example, when a group or
community decide that drugs and using drugs are important, they may
start to apply a social pressure on those outside them, to convince
these people to try what they are doing. As humans, we are creatures of
social tendencies, we want to fit in somewhere, even if it's not the
mainstream. So, what do social pressures have to do with finances?
Advertising. Why do you buy what you buy? Why buy these expensive shoes
over the plain cheaper ones? Advertising seeks to make you think
something you want, like a fancy pair of shoes, is something you need,
a purchase you need to fit into society, and that pressure is a great
factor in making you pick a product, hire a service, or even vote for a
political party.<br><br><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Finance
