													<h1>A Personal Finance Guide for the Modern Person</h1><address>By Joe Sedutto, September 2018<br><br></address>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Personal finance, a lot of people know right off what personal finance
is, its your personal, finances, your money, and more importantly, how
you mannage your own money. If you search "Personal Finance" into
google, you get, thousands, millions, almost a billion results and
counting artcicles and blogs and studies all with an underlying peice
of advice "Save more than you Spend" well, there you go, personal
finance seems easy, with such simple advice at our fingertips, it leads
me to wonder why in this year, the average person spends 133% of their
income.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 133% thats an extra 1/3d dollar spend
for each dollar they earn, people overspend, people go into debt,
why?&nbsp;In a study 2017, with research from a year or so earlier,
CNBC reported that;<br><table style="width: 556px; height: 80px; text-align: left; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr><td align="center">"Only 8 percent of [people polled] had a high level of knowledge, while 
about a quarter, or 24 percent, demonstrated just a basic understanding 
of how to manage their money. Yet 69 percent gave themselves high marks 
for financial know-how."<br><address>-Jessica Dickler, "Millennials aren't as smart about money as they think"&nbsp;&nbsp; </address></td></tr></tbody></table>if personal finance is so easy how can you have millions of americans
going into debt like this. Obviously, we can figure this out, its clear
this wisdom is old, unrefuted, and, by the 133% fact, the advice is
ignored, so what can you do?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People need another kind of
article, a guide that does not just tell you what to do to not
overspend, a guide that tells you why you are overspending, beacuse its
clear that using conventional wisdom is not working, just like telling
a smoker that smoking is bad, telling a person that debt is bad wont
make them stop.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Social Preasure. Social preasure is just what it sounds like, society
putting preasure on you, you experince social preasure when you're
waiting in line for coffee, you dont cut in front beacuse society tells
you its bad, you wear clothes when you're in town beacuse society has
preasured you to do that, and thats ok, social preasure is a double
edged sword, able to keep a community together, but also able to make a
communtiy do something, for example, when a group or community decide
that drugs and using drugs are important, they may start to apply a
social preasure to those outside them, to convince these people to try
what they are doing. A humans, we are creatures of social tendancies,
we want to fit in somewhere, even if its not the mainstream. So, what
do social preasures have to do with finances? Advertising. Why do you
buy what you buy? Why buy these expensive shoes over the plain cheaper
ones? Advertising seeks to make you think something you want, like a
fancy pair of shoes, is something you need, a purchace you need to fit
into society, and that preasure is a great factor in making you pick a
product, hire a service, or even vote for a political party.<br><br><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Finance
- Finance is money, the management and use of money, when you finance a
thing you send money, when you mannage your finances you are controling
the flow of money that you have</li><li>Debt - Debt is when you owe something, you are in debt if you owe money, services, or something else to sombody else.</li><li>Invest
- To invest is to pur forth some wealth now and expect a growth later,
for example, stocks, bonds. You can imagine it like a farmer watering
his crops, putting in some work and wealth now for a harvest later that
will be worth more than his original imput</li><li>Income - income is money coming in, weather it be salary, commision, or investments</li><li>Conventional
wisdom - conventional wisdom is old wisdom, useful but, not in debth
and not always applicable in places where its used (STUB)</li><li>Advertising - advertising is</li><li>Value: Depreciate -&nbsp;</li><li>Liablity -&nbsp;</li><li>Credit -&nbsp;</li><li>Credit Score - </li></ul><br></div>
